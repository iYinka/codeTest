Task 1:

Use the Json Placeholder free API to create a CRUD application

API Resource - http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/

Your API should have basic form validations



Task 2:

Use the free IMDB API provide by RapidAPI to create a chart.

Use the route /actors/get-awards to get awarded actors

Use the `year` field to calculate and build any chart of your choice (bar, line, pie, etc)

Generate a new field, `count` which is the number of occurrence of each year.

Plot the chart against this new field, `count`.

i.e 2008 == 3, 2007 == 2; means the year 2008 had 3 awards, and 2007 had 2 awards.

The total dataset to consider should be 22 awards.
